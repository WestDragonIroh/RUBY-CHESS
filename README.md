# Ruby Chess

This project is from Ruby curriculum at
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four).

## Description

Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents
on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours,
commonly white and black. White moves first, after which the players alternate
turns in accordance with fixed rules, each player attempting to force the
opponent’s principal piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is
unable to avoid capture.
